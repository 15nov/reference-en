= Reference-en
Reference-en is the repo for the Language Reference documentation of the Arduino syntax in **English**.  
All the Reference terms files are in AsciiDoc format. Manutius, the Arduino platform to manage and publish content, turns Asciidoc documents into HTML pages, PDFs, and more.

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Arduino content, this is really helpful to the whole Arduino Community.

== Content Creation and Editing
If you want to contribute new content, create a new file (with any text or code editor) and save it as .adoc.  
Do not use parenthesis or any special character in the file name.  
In https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduino/reference-en/master/AsciiDoc_sample/AsciiDoc_Dictionary/AsciiDoc_Template-Dictionary.adoc[`reference-en/AsciiDoc_sample/AsciiDoc_Dictionary`] you will find an overview on the AsciiDoc syntax in use on the Manutius platform. This includes Titles, Text, Links, Images, Tables, Code and various embeds (video, slideshow, audio and code). You can see it rendered https://cdn.arduino.cc/reference/en/asciidoc_sample/asciidoc_dictionary/asciidoc_template-dictionary/[here].

If you want to contribute to the Language Reference or edit existing content, you can find two templates in reference-en/AsciiDoc_sample/Reference_Terms:

* Use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduino/reference-en/master/AsciiDoc_sample/Reference_Terms/AsciiDoc_Template-Single_Entity.adoc[`AsciiDoc_Template-Single_Entity.adoc`] (rendered https://cdn.arduino.cc/reference/en/asciidoc_sample/reference_terms/asciidoc_template-single_entity/[here]) for terms such as link:http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogWrite[analogWrite].
* Use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduino/reference-en/master/AsciiDoc_sample/Reference_Terms/AsciiDoc_Template-Parent_Of_Entities.adoc[`AsciiDoc_Template-Parent_Of_Entities.adoc`] (rendered https://cdn.arduino.cc/reference/en/asciidoc_sample/reference_terms/asciidoc_template-parent_of_entities/[here]) for groups of functions such as link:http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Serial[Serial].

Please note that every Reference file should include as least a Description, some Example Code, and links to other relevant infos (See Also section). 

If you need to add images to the Asciidoc please create a folder called attachments in the same directory as the Asciidoc file. Images can be saved in SVG and PNG format, max size 200KB.

== Contribute Content on Github
If you are not familiar with Git you can contribute content directly on Github via their online interface. link:https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/[Follow this guide] to learn how to edit an .adoc file and propose a file change to the Arduino team.  
When suggesting a change, please follow the guidelines described in the Reference template files.


== Submitting a pull request

We are glad you want to contribute with code: that's the best way to help this software.

Your contribution is adding or modifying existing behaviour, please always refer to an existing issue or open a new one before contributing. We are are trying to use [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) in the near future: please add one or more tests that prove that your contribution is good and is working as expected, it will help us a lot.

Be sure to use `go vet` and `go fmt` on every file before each commit: it ensures your code is properly formatted.

Also, for your contribution to be accepted, everyone of your commits must be "Signed-off". This is done by commiting using this command: `git commit --signoff`

By signing off your commits, you agree to the following agreement, also known as link:http://developercertificate.org/[Developer Certificate of Origin] it assures everyone that the code you're submitting is yours or that you have rights to submit it.
