=== Description
[%hardbreaks]
`break` is used to exit from a link:for{ext-relative}[for], link:while{ext-relative}[while] or link:doWhile{ext-relative}[do...while] loop, bypassing the normal loop condition. It is also used to exit from a link:switchCase{ext-relative}[switch case] statement.

=== Example Code
In the following code, the control exits the `for` loop when the sensor value exceeds the threshold.
[source,arduino]
----
for (x = 0; x < 255; x ++)
{
    digitalWrite(PWMpin, x);
    sens = analogRead(sensorPin);
    if (sens > threshold){      // bail out on sensor detect
       x = 0;
       break;
    }
    delay(50);
}
